# gross - A RSS Server Written in Go

Gross is a simple RSS server which can be used to export a directory of files as a RSS feed. It was born out of a need to address a growing pile of unconsumed video and audio files while travelling with limited connectivity, an implemented as a working project for the Go Belfast Group.

Gross runs as a daemon, polling it's configured directories to detect new files and adding them to the feed.
